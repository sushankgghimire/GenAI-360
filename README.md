# GenAI-360

This repository contains notes, code, and exercises from my learning journey on [ActiveLoop](https://learn.activeloop.ai/).

## Overview

I am currently learning various topics related to data management, machine learning, and AI using ActiveLoop's resources. This repository serves as a collection of my progress, including:

- **Course Notes**: Summaries and key takeaways from each lesson.
- **Code Examples**: Practical implementations and exercises.
- **Versioning**: Although the original course uses langchain and other libraries from previous versions, I've tried to write the same code using langchain 0.2.x

## Resources

- [ActiveLoop Learning Platform](https://learn.activeloop.ai/)

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the content in this repository. Each directory corresponds to a specific topic or module covered on the platform. Clone the repo and run the notebooks locally to follow along with the exercises. Lets discuss if you find something interesting or a bug.
