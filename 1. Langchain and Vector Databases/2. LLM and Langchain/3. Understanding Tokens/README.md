# Tokenizer Showcase with GPT-2 Tokenizer

This notebook provides a brief overview of what a tokenizer does, using the GPT-2 tokenizer as an example. Tokenizers are a fundamental part of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, as they break down text into tokens that can be easily processed by machine learning models.

## What is a Tokenizer?

A tokenizer converts a string of text into smaller pieces called tokens. These tokens can be words, subwords, or even characters, depending on the specific tokenizer. In this notebook, we explore how the GPT-2 tokenizer works, including how it handles different text inputs.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Tokenization Process:** Demonstrates how the GPT-2 tokenizer splits text into tokens and converts them to their corresponding IDs.
