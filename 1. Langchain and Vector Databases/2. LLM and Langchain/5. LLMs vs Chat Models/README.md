# Comparing LLMs with Chat Models: An Analytical Exploration

This notebook is dedicated to exploring and comparing the performance of different types of language models: a traditional LLM and a specialized chat model. The comparison includes a quantized version of the CausalLM 7B and the ChatMistralAI model. This exploration aims to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, providing insights into their applications in various NLP tasks.

## Overview

In recent advancements in NLP, both large language models (LLMs) and chat models have shown significant potential in generating human-like text. This notebook compares these two types of models by evaluating their performance across a series of tasks, ranging from text generation to conversational dialogue.

### Models Compared

1. **Quantized CausalLM 7B**:
    - A large language model optimized for general text generation tasks. The quantized version is utilized to enhance performance on devices with limited computational power while maintaining high-quality output.

2. **ChatMistralAI**:
    - A chat-specific model designed to handle conversational contexts more effectively. This model is tested against CausalLM to evaluate its specialized capabilities in dialogue-based tasks.
