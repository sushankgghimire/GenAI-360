# LangChain with Quantized LLMs: A Comprehensive Exploration

This notebook showcases the power of LangChain in orchestrating multiple tasks using various Large Language Models (LLMs). The models used in this notebook include a quantized version of Llama 2 Chat, Phi-3 Mini 4K Instruct, and the Mistral API. Each model is employed to handle distinct tasks, demonstrating their capabilities and performance in different scenarios.

## Overview

LangChain is a versatile framework that allows developers to build powerful applications by chaining together language models and other computational components. In this notebook, we explore several tasks using different quantized LLMs to compare their efficiency, accuracy, and usability.

### Models Explored

1. **Quantized Llama 2 Chat**: 
    - A chat model known for its conversational abilities. In this notebook, a quantized version is used to optimize performance while retaining the model's effectiveness in generating human-like responses.
    - Implemented using `llama-cpp` to handle the GGUF model files.

2. **Phi-3 Mini 4K Instruct**: 
    - An instructive model, fine-tuned for handling directive tasks. This quantized version helps reduce resource consumption, making it suitable for deployment in environments with limited computational power.
    - Also implemented using `llama-cpp` for efficient handling of GGUF model files.

3. **Mistral API**: 
    - A powerful API for handling complex language tasks. This notebook uses Mistral to demonstrate the model's flexibility and precision in processing and generating text.
