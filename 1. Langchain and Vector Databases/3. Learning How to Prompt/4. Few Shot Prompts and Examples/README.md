# Advanced Few-Shot Learning with Meta-Llama-3-8B.Q8_0.gguf

This notebook focuses on advanced few-shot learning techniques using the Meta-Llama-3-8B.Q8_0.gguf model. It explores the effectiveness of different example selectors in optimizing the few-shot learning process, including `LengthBasedExampleSelector` and `SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector`.

## Key Features:
- **Model Used**: The Meta-Llama-3-8B.Q8_0.gguf model, a quantized 8-bit version of the LLaMA 8B model, was used for all few-shot learning experiments. This model offers efficient performance, making it ideal for experiments involving multiple prompt configurations.

- **Few-Shot Learning**: The notebook dives deep into few-shot learning, providing the model with a small number of examples within the prompt to improve its ability to generalize from limited data. This approach is particularly useful for complex tasks where the model needs more guidance.

- **Example Selectors**:
  - **LengthBasedExampleSelector**: This selector chooses examples based on their length, ensuring that the selected examples fit within the model's token limits while still providing valuable information. It is particularly useful in scenarios where managing the prompt size is critical.
  - **SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector**: This selector prioritizes examples that are semantically similar to the input, helping the model to better understand and generate relevant responses. This technique is effective in improving the coherence and relevance of the model's output.

## Observations:
- **Impact of Example Selection**: The choice of example selector significantly influences the quality of the model's output in few-shot learning scenarios. `LengthBasedExampleSelector` helps in maintaining prompt efficiency, while `SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector` enhances the relevance of responses.

- **Optimization of Few-Shot Learning**: By experimenting with different selectors, the notebook demonstrates how to optimize the few-shot learning process for different tasks, achieving better results through tailored prompt engineering.

## Conclusion:
This notebook provides a detailed exploration of few-shot learning techniques using the Meta-Llama-3-8B.Q8_0.gguf model. By comparing different example selectors, it offers insights into how to fine-tune the few-shot learning process to maximize model performance.
