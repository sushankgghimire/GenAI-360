# Exploring Prompt Templates with Meta-Llama-3-8B.Q8_0

This notebook delves into the usage of prompt templates with the Meta-Llama-3-8B.Q8_0.gguf model. The primary focus is on understanding and applying different types of prompt templates to enhance model performance, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.

## Key Features:
- **Model Used**: The Meta-Llama-3-8B.Q8_0.gguf model, a quantized 8-bit version of the LLaMA 8B model, was used for all experiments in this notebook. The quantization allows for efficient inference while maintaining model performance.

- **PromptTemplate**: The notebook starts with the basics of using `PromptTemplate`, demonstrating how to create and utilize templates to structure prompts in a way that guides the model's output effectively.

- **FewShotLearningPromptTemplate**: Building on the basics, this section explores the `FewShotLearningPromptTemplate`, which is designed to provide the model with a few examples to learn from within the prompt. This technique is crucial for tasks where the model needs to generalize from limited data.

- **LengthBasedExampleSelector**: The notebook also incorporates the `LengthBasedExampleSelector` to optimize the few-shot learning process. This selector chooses examples based on their length, ensuring that the prompt stays within the model's token limits while still providing relevant information.

## Observations:
- **Prompt Engineering**: The effectiveness of prompts can significantly impact the quality of the model's output. The structured approach provided by `PromptTemplate` helps in creating more coherent and focused prompts.

- **Few-Shot Learning**: The `FewShotLearningPromptTemplate` proved to be a powerful tool, enabling the model to generate better results by learning from a few examples provided in the prompt.

- **Efficiency with Length-Based Example Selection**: Using the `LengthBasedExampleSelector` helps in managing the token count effectively, ensuring that the model's responses remain within acceptable limits without sacrificing the quality of the examples provided.

## Conclusion:
This notebook provides a comprehensive overview of using prompt templates with the Meta-Llama-3-8B.Q8_0.gguf model. By experimenting with different prompting techniques, including few-shot learning and length-based example selection, it showcases the importance of prompt engineering in guiding LLMs to produce high-quality outputs.
