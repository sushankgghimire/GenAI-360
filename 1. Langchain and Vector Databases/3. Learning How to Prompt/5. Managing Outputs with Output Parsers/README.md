## Exploring LangChain Output Parsers with Mistral AI

In this notebook, I explored various output parsers provided by LangChain, including:

- **PydanticOutputParser**: Utilized for validating and parsing output into Pydantic models, ensuring structured and type-safe results.
- **CommaSeparatedListOutputParser**: A straightforward parser designed to handle comma-separated lists, making it ideal for parsing simple, delimited outputs.
- **StructuredOutputParser with ResponseSchema**: Enables parsing structured outputs using a defined schema, ensuring that the output adheres to expected formats.
- **OutputFixingParser**: Automatically attempts to fix outputs that don't match the expected structure, making it robust for dealing with unpredictable outputs.
- **RetryWithErrorOutputParser**: Designed to retry the parsing process in case of errors, enhancing reliability in parsing complex outputs.

For this exploration, I used the Mistral AI model to generate outputs, testing each parser's capabilities and limitations.
