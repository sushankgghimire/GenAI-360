# Knowledge Graph Creation with NetworkX and PyVis

In this notebook, I created a knowledge graph using **NetworkX** and visualized it with **PyVis** through **LangChain**. The notebook explores the process of building a knowledge graph, connecting nodes and edges, and displaying it interactively.

## Overview

- **Tools Used**: 
  - **NetworkX**: For creating the graph structure.
  - **PyVis**: For visualizing the graph in an interactive format.
  - **LangChain**: As the framework to integrate and run the graph creation process.

- **Key Insights**:
  - The method described in the course I followed is outdated. There are now much easier and more efficient ways to create and visualize knowledge graphs.
  - The PyVis library provides a highly interactive way to explore knowledge graphs, making it easier to analyze connections.

## Methodology

1. **Graph Creation**:
   - Nodes and edges were generated using NetworkX to represent entities and their relationships.
   - Various attributes and properties were added to nodes and edges to enrich the graph.

2. **Visualization**:
   - The graph was then converted into a PyVis object to visualize it interactively.
   - Customizations were applied to ensure the graph is clear, with all edges and labels visible.

3. **Challenges**:
   - The original course method was cumbersome and involved unnecessary complexity.
   - The updated approach streamlines the process, making knowledge graph creation more accessible and less time-consuming.

## Conclusion

This notebook serves as a demonstration of how to efficiently create and visualize knowledge graphs using modern tools and libraries. It highlights the need for updated methodologies in educational content to match current best practices.
